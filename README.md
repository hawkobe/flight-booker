# README

This is a project for TOP (The Odin Project) where we are working with advanced forms and nested data to allow users to input information all in one form.

This app aims to allow a user (passenger) to search for flights using dates and airports, see displayed lists of available flights, fill out passenger info and "pay" using a portal.

Will be implementing collections, radio buttons, and nested submissions.
